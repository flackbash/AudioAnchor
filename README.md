## Features
AudioAnchor offers a clean and intuitive interface for listening to audio files while keeping track of listening progress.

Additional features include:
- Set bookmarks
- Adjust playback speed
- Export and import listening progress as SQL database
- Sleep timer
- Lock screen media controls (for Android 5.0 Lollipop and higher)

## Installation
The best way is to install [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) on your Android device, search for AudioAnchor, and install the app from there. This way, AudioAnchor will automatically be kept up to date on your device.\
Alternatively, you can download the latest apk from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.prangesoftwaresolutions.audioanchor/) (or from [releases](https://github.com/flackbash/AudioAnchor/releases)) and execute it on your device.\
The latest release runs on devices with Android API level 19 (Android 4.4 KitKat) and higher.

## Usage
Start off by adding directories to your library. When adding a new directory you have two options:
* You can add a directory that contains audio files
* You can add a directory that contains subdirectories which contain audio files

For example, you might have a directory `Podcast History Hour` that contains audio files.
Add this directory to your library using the option *Add directory that contains audio files*.
Additionally, you might have a directory `AudioBooks` that contains subdirectories such as `The Hobbit` or `Harry Potter II` each of which contains one or several audio files.
You can add this directory to your library using the option *Add directory with subdirectories that contain audio files*.\
This prevents you from having to add your audio books one by one.

Add cover images to the subdirectories to have a neat looking app as shown in the screenshots below.

Browse and play your audio files just as you would in any other audio player.

## Permissions
AudioAnchor asks for the following permissions:

- Write external storage (to export the listening progress)
- Read phone state (to pause the audio during a call)
